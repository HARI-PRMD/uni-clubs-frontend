Thursdays in weeks 2 and 6, and in-person discussion happening at 5pm Thursdays in weeks 4 and 8. Discussions are focused around the book before getting more generally social, so we recommend you read at least some of the book being discussed. Books are selected by preferential vote, and we welcome suggestions from club members. Aside from that we hold a number of less regular events including collaborations with other clubs; book swaps are a frequent element of such events. \n\nIf you'd like to know more or would like to get one of our bookmarks then pop down to our O-week stall.",

And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. Matthew 28:19-20 Statement of Faith: As a Chinese Christian fellowship, we are called to be committed to evangelism to the Chinese community at UNSW. We rejoice in our fellowship with brothers and sisters from local churches across Sydney, and pray that God will make us a humble, vigorous, attractive fellowship, bringing the good news especially to those who have never heard of Jesus Christ. In light of our nature as a Christian fellowship with members from different church backgrounds and for the sake of clarity and integrity in all our work and relationships, we humbly declare the following fundamental truths of the Christian faith and mission: 1. We believe in the one, holy, sovereign, creating and redeeming God, eternally existing in three Persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 2. We believe in the divine inspiration and entire trustworthiness of the Bible, its infallible teaching and supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct; and its normative value for all peoples, at all times, in all cultures. We believe that all people without distinction are made in the image of God, but all are now sinners and have incurred both God?s holy wrath and their own shame and guilt. All are therefore in utter need of redemption. 3. We believe in Jesus Christ our Lord, the incarnate Son of God, uniquely God-man and the only Savior. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless life, sacrificial death, bodily resurrection and ascension. We believe He has achieved the final defeat of Satan and all evil powers. 4. We believe in the justification of sinners by God?s grace, through faith in Christ alone. 5. We believe in the Holy Spirit and His convicting, regenerating, sanctifying and reviving work. He guides and empowers individuals and churches in their service to God and all people. 6. We believe in the unity and priesthood of all believers who together form the one, holy, universal, apostolic church. 7. We believe in the visible, personal return of Jesus Christ in power and great glory to judge both the living and the dead. We believe that the Scriptures set out only two destinies for humanity; the joyful prospect of eternal life in the presence of God for those who have received Christ and the agonizing prospect of eternal separation from God for those who have rejected Him.",

Since our establishment in 2018, we have been aiming to create a fun, friendly and tight-knit community for everyone in UNSW who enjoys ice skating, regardless of skill level or experience. \n\nIceSoc holds Weekly Social Skating Sessions at Ice Zoo in Mascot every Thursday from 6:00 - 7:30 pm. No matter if you are a \"winter veteran\" or have never skated before, you will always find these sessions an opportunity to improve your skating skills and form lasting friendships. We have members at every skill level and are always happy to teach! \n\nDespite having Ice Zoo as our home rink, IceSoc also holds social skating sessions at Liverpool Ice Rink and Macquarie Ice Rink, in order to make us more accessible for members living further away from the university.\n\nThroughout the year, IceSoc collaborates with other societies in UNSW to hold events on a bigger scale. Many of them combine ice skating with fun themes. Past examples include Disney on Ice, a costumed ice skating party and Vivid on Ice, a disco on-ice party with dance music.\n\nIf you are looking for the ultimate IceSoc experience, please ask one of our friendly execs for an IceSoc Gold Card. The Gold Card allows its holder to enjoy $5 off at every public session at Ice Zoo, our home rink until the next academic year. Note that the price of the gold card is still subject to change, so please stay tuned to our announcements if you're keen to get one!\n\n",

Our discussions are very beginner friendly and we provide materials that describe what each topic we discuss is about. If you want to join us, all you need is a little bit of interest. \n\nPhilosophy covers a range of very diverse topics, from how we can know what is true with certainty, to whether God exists, to why certain acts are morally right or wrong. It can be rather difficult to define, but ultimately it asks one question: Why? \n\nIf you've ever asked \"Why?\", then you're on track to becoming a philosopher. Philosophy can be thought of as the study of thinking about things deeply. We question things in philosophy. Even the most basic things. Thinking deeply about the world can be very intriguing. \n\nJoin us, the UNSW Philosophy Society, if you want to engage in discussions about philosophy and meet like-minded people. ",

Occasionally, we also like to attend external piano recitals and concerts together.\n\nOver the last year, we've developed a large community on our Discord server, which is our primary form of contact with each other. We chat there on an almost daily basis to share piano music and engage in more general discussions about university life. Our server features dedicated voice channels for members to stream their piano practice and obtain feedback and advice from those who listen in. More recently, we've also made use of Discord's new Watch Together feature as a means of listening to piano music together while we carry on with our studies.\n\nIf you play the piano at any level or simply take an interest in the art of piano composition and performance, then this is the society for you!\n",

With such a diverse offering, we have something for almost every student – whether you want to make some friends or do some networking; pick and choose!\n\n \n\nComing up in the year ahead we have the return of our PPE Soc book club – a chance to have a casual chat and meal while we discuss an important book from the fields of P, P or E! Also retuning is our collaboration with UNSW DebSoc –‘Debate or Origin’ – which should see the re-emergence of some truly spicy arguments.\n\n \n\nMore immediately, we have some great events happening in Term 1. After some first year drinks (Week 1 – day TBC!), Week 3 sees the long awaited and planned-for Start of Launch, where different years can mix and catch up on stories about the Summer Break. Excitingly, PPE Soc will also be joining a social sport competition in Week 7 – against ArtSoc, PhilSoc, UNSoc, DipSoc and ASEANSoc. Finally, on the far horizon (Term 2, Week 1) PPE Soc will be holding a panel on the upcoming Voice to Parliament referendum – come along a hear from some local Elders and academics about an important moment in Australian politics.\n\nFor more info or to get involved, chuck us a follow on Instagram - @unswppesoc.

      "PsychSoc is the constituent society which aims to engage, support, and connect all UNSW Psychology students. At PsychSoc, we are united by one core mission: to foster a sense of connectedness and community, benefiting our students by supporting their endeavours and providing opportunities to explore, enhance and work towards their goals during their University journey. We want to help you get the most out of your time in psychology, and hence aim to provide events throughout the year for the psychology student community here. Whether you are looking for social events, academic help, or career information, we?ve got you covered! Collaborating with other UNSW societies, as well as in-university and external organisations, we ensure that every psychology student will have the most enriching university experience here. PsychSoc's foundations stand upon six portfolios which innovate, organise and facilitate PsychSoc's events - Academic, Social, Relations, the Year Representatives, Wellbeing and Marketing and Media. The Academic team assists with improving the academic lifestyle and understanding of Psychology students through coding, writing, and exam workshops; whereas the Social team looks to run fun-filled events, forgetting about the stresses of university studies. The Relations portfolio helps students take the first step into connecting with the professional workplace, opening opportunities for you to talk to employers and understand what they look for in a psychology graduate. The Year Representatives bridge PsychSoc with the wider year cohorts, listening to issues, a voice to the student body, and strives to create events that introduces students to new friends in their year group. Sports and Philanthropy is all about building a student culture that remembers to share a bit of love; whether it's self-care, caring for the community or just taking the time to look after one's mental or physical health. All the events PsychSoc pulls together are only made possible by students attending them, and the Marketing and Media team shapes the event pages and marketing material for our events to ensure everyone knows what the society is up to next. The Academic Portfolio assists Psychology students with their course work, providing a range of academic resources such as workshops and Psychology core practice exams. The Social portfolio unites the Psychology student body and facilitates long-lasting bonds within a tight-knit society through inclusive, accessible and lively social events. The Relations portfolio helps students take the first step into connecting with the professional workplace, opening opportunities for you to talk to employers and understand what they look for in a psychology graduate. The Wellbeing Portfolio promotes events that are related to philanthropy and mental health with an overarching goal to improve individual wellbeing in the Psychology community. The Year Representatives are the bridge between the PsychSoc committee and the broader Psychology cohort, facilitating student engagement within each year group and being an open and accessible line of communication for students. All the events by PsychSoc are only made possible by students attending them, with the Marketing and Media team promoting events via a variety of engaging media to ensure everyone knows what the society is up to next! Overseeing all the portfolios is our executive team: the President, Vice-President Operations, the Secretary, the Arc Delegate, the Treasurer, and the Vice-President Internal. When you ask PsychSoc any questions, give us feedback or even just start a chat with us over email or Facebook, our Secretary is the one who replies. The Secretary is our go-to member and will know nearly everything and anything about our society. Our Arc Delegate keeps PsychSoc aligned with Arc, which is a student-run body that ensures all societies and clubs continue to provide services that cater to the students. The Treasurer budgets our spending so we can continue to run our events and will be the one to confirm that your payment has come through to our PsychSoc bank account. The Vice-President Internal facilitates the internal aspect of the committee, overseeing conflict resolution and bonding, and ensuring the committee members are meshing well together. The President and Vice-President work together to lead the committee, drawing from the four characteristics that stimulate the society to always work diligently to create a better UNSW. We are excited to welcome you to join our Psychology community! To keep up to date with all our events and initiatives throughout the year, make sure to do the following: 1. Join us on SpArc 2.

We promote a culture of inclusiveness to learn and grow together. The project often requires members to work under high pressure, accelerating the development of critical problem-solving abilities. Redback participates   in   two competitions annually, Formula SAE-A and FS-Sydney. FSAE-A allows students the opportunity to enhance their engineering design and project management skills. It prepares students for a career in various industries and provides the opportunity to network on a global scale. FS-Sydney is another highly rewarding experience for several students across Australia.  \n\n \n\nStudents have the opportunity to choose between two branches: Technical & Business. The Technical team oversees the design, manufacturing, and testing of the car. The Business team upholds the operations, finances, and branding of the team. There are opportunities throughout the team where students can diversify their skill set and meet like-minded individuals. Now transitioned to electric vehicles, we build off a remarkably successful 20-year history competing and placing podium in the combustion class - there is a lot to live up to. With the partnership of major sponsors every year, Redback Racing can develop faster and more lightweight cars to compete with in domestic and international competitions.

      "The University Network for Investing and Trading (UNIT) was established in 2007 and is an active student-run society. Although UNIT originally geared towards those interested in investing and trading, we have now expanded to cater to those interested in all aspects of finance. UNIT spreads across six premier Australian universities; The University of Sydney, The University of New South Wales, Macquarie University, University of Melbourne, Monash University and University of Queensland. We strive to provide financial education for novices and experts alike through our educational seminars, promote career opportunities through Facebook, weekly e-Newsletters and our website and provide professional networking opportunities for students spread across a broad range of degrees and majors. Some of our keynote events included the Citi Global Markets Challenge, Industry Insights Evening and Diversity in Finance. Over the years, UNIT has rapidly become one of the most dynamic and enthusiastically supported student bodies on campus, enjoying a strong reputation for energy and professionalism. UNIT has over 11,000 student members. The genuine value offered to members underlies our continual growth and stamps UNIT as the largest finance focused student organisations in Australia. While there are many commerce-themed societies on campus, two key aspects of UNIT's philosophy sets it distinctly apart from the pack: Firstly, UNIT's mission is pure and simple: to provide free education to students interested in trading and investing. UNIT hosts talks and presentations from industry leaders - including hedge funds, boutique funds, brokers, market-making traders and the ASX - that not only introduce students to the fundamentals of investing and trading, but expose students to industry practices not taught inside the classroom and textbook. Secondly, UNIT is student-focused. While useful careers-wise, the education provided by UNIT aims to equip students with the knowledge and confidence to start up and manage their own share portfolios and invest for life. No doubt many students begin university wondering how they too can trade shares and other instruments - UNIT aims to answer that question. As part of our student-focus, we try to cater to as many students as possible. As such UNIT also holds a variety of other events, including our inaugural Stock Pitch Challenge, workshops, coffee with a professional, poker night and round table discussions. We believe this philosophy, coupled with the unbridled enthusiasm and dedication of the UNIT team makes us a valuable contribution to student life on campus.",
